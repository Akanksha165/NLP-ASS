            "**1. WIDAL TEST:** This test checks for antibodies against *Salmonella* bacteria, which can cause typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever.  The results are reported as dilutions. A higher number indicates a stronger immune response (meaning the body is fighting the infection).\n",
            "\n",
            "* **S. Typhi \"O\" 1:160:**  This indicates a significant antibody response to the \"O\" antigen of *Salmonella Typhi* (the bacteria that causes typhoid fever).  The reference range is 1:20, so this result is much higher than normal, suggesting a possible past or present typhoid infection.\n",
            "* **S. Typhi \"H\" 1:80:**  This shows a moderate antibody response to the \"H\" antigen of *Salmonella Typhi*. Again, higher than the reference range of 1:20.\n",
            "* **S. Paratyphi \"AH\" 1:20:**  This result is within the normal range for antibodies to the \"AH\" antigen of *Salmonella Paratyphi* (causes paratyphoid fever).\n",
            "* **S. Paratyphi \"BH\" 1:20:** This result is within the normal range for antibodies to the \"BH\" antigen of *Salmonella Paratyphi*.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Important Note:**  A positive Widal test doesn't definitively diagnose typhoid or paratyphoid.  Other tests are needed to confirm.  The high titres for S. Typhi suggest past exposure or current infection, which warrants further investigation.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "**2. DENGUE SEROLOGY:** This tests for dengue fever, a mosquito-borne viral illness.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Dengue NS1 Antigen:** Negative –  This means the test didn't detect the NS1 protein, which is present during the acute phase of dengue infection.\n",
            "* **Dengue IgG:** Negative – This antibody indicates past exposure to dengue virus.  A negative result suggests no past infection.\n",
            "* **Dengue IgM:** Negative – This antibody usually appears during the acute phase of dengue infection. A negative result suggests no current infection.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "**3. ERYTHROCYTE SEDIMENTATION RATE (ESR):** This measures how quickly red blood cells settle in a test tube.  A higher rate often indicates inflammation or infection in the body.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **ESR 1st Hour 26 mm/hr:**  This is higher than the normal range (0-8 mm/hr).\n",

            "\n",
            "\n",

            "* **Serum Sodium:** 122 mmol/l (Normal: 135-146 mmol/l). Slightly low.\n",
